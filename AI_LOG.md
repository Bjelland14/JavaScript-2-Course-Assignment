## AI Usage Log

## Tool Used
ChatGPT

## Usage Period
16.02.26 – 22.02.26

## Purpose
Concept clarification, debugging assistance, and deployment troubleshooting

## What AI Was Used For
- Debugging TypeScript type errors
- Understanding how to properly type DOM elements using TypeScript generics (e.g., `querySelector<HTML...>`)
- Explaining differences between localStorage and sessionStorage
- Troubleshooting GitHub Pages deployment issues
- Improving form validation and error handling logic
- Minor UX adjustments (follow/unfollow visibility and navigation placement)

## What AI Was NOT Used For
- No full application was generated automatically
- No complete pages or features were copy-pasted without understanding
- No core architecture decisions were made solely by AI
- All final implementation decisions were reviewed, tested, and structured manually

## Notes
AI was used strictly as a learning and debugging support tool.
All concepts were understood before implementation, and the final structure and logic of the application were completed independently after reviewing the explanations provided.
